# Example for finetuning a transit lightcurve model based on measured data

## About

This notebook creates a model based transit light curve, and tunes this light curve based on expiremental data from exoplanet HD209458b using the $\chi^{2}$ method.

## Credits

The methods used are described in Chapter 3 of _Transiting Exoplanets: Measuring the Properties of Planetary Systems_ by Haswell, taught at astronomy module [S382 Astrophysics](http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/s382) of the the OpenUniversity, UK.

The data used is based on the observations of the transiting planet system c as presented in figure 2 of
